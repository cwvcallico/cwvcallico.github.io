  <h1>Welcome to my Online Portfolio!</h1><hr width="5px"/><br/>
  
  <p>Hi there! I'm Callista Winegar-Valdez, a creative coder looking for professional development opportunities! If you some help with developing your website, feel free to submit your request along with your contact information below, and I'll respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you.</p>
  
  <p>Since I was a child, I've always relished the idea of exploration, learning, and creating. My world was an open book to me, filled with cool animals, plants, colors, music, and more. Every new thing invoked a great desire to learn in me, and to this day, this desire resides in me. I wish to cultivate this further by exploring the world of programming and web development--through web development, new applicaitons and tools can be built to inspire and help others as we navigate an ever-increasing technology-laden world. Plus, the beauty of web development is that it's not all about building basic tools, but it's about having fun with designs, animations, and other features that liven up a website and those who visit it.</p>
  
  <p>With my passion to create whimsy and fun in everyday life, but also pour in serious effort, time, and dedication to any project I handle, I can provide you with an amazing web development experience. As a down-to-earth person with a background in psychology and administration, I have a great understanding of how people work, how to interact with others in an agreeable manner, and I know how the world works. I promise to give my 110% to every venture I undertake.</p>
